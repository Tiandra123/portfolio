# Advanced Python Class Assignments

This folder contains projects completed for my Advanced Python course as part of my MIS Master's program at USU. All projects were developed and tested on a AWS EC2 instance using VS Code.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Blackjack Game (`blackjack.py`)

A command-line Blackjack implementation featuring complete game logic and user interaction.

**Key Features:**
- User input handling for hit/stay decisions
- Card dealing and score tracking
- House play rules (house hits when score â‰¤ 17)
- Bust detection and win/loss evaluation
- Game restart functionality
- Five-card Charlie rule implementation

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming
- AWS EC2 for development environment

**Note:** This project uses a `DeckOfCards.py` class provided by the instructor.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure you have the `DeckOfCards.py` file in the same directory 
2. Run: `python blackjack.py`
