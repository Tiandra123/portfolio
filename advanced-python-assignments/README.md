# Advanced Python Class Assignments

This folder contains projects I completed for my Python courses as part of my MIS Master's program at USU. All projects were developed and tested on AWS EC2 instances using VS Code, or Cloud9.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Detector (`crypto_arbitrage.py`)

A network-based arbitrage detection system for cryptocurrency markets using graph theory algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time price data retrieval from CoinGecko API
- Weighted directed graph construction
- Graph traversal algorithms to find trading paths
- Arbitrage opportunity identification
- Forward and reverse path analysis
- Profit/loss calculations for trading opportunities

**Supported Cryptocurrencies:**
- Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC)
- Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), EOS

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- NetworkX for graph theory operations
- REST APIs for real-time data
- Mathematical analysis for arbitrage detection

**How to Run:**
1. Install required libraries: `pip install networkx requests matplotlib`
2. Run: `python crypto_arbitrage.py`
3. View arbitrage opportunities in the console output

### 4. Energy Efficiency Analysis Tool (`energy_analysis.py`) - My First Big Python Project!

A comprehensive energy analysis system that examines electricity generation efficiency across Western US states.

**Key Features:**
- REST API integration with U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA.gov)
- Multi-state data processing (UT, MT, ID, WY, CO, CA, AZ, NV, OR, WA)
- Analysis of multiple fuel types (coal, petroleum, natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, solar)
- Efficiency calculations (BTU input vs electricity output)
- Automated data updates with date validation
- Null value handling and data cleaning
- JSON export of processed results
- historical data analysis over multiple years

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- REST APIs & JSON processing
