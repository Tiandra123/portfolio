# Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains my machine learning projects completed as part of my coursework for my Master's degree in Management Information Systems at the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business, Utah State University (USU).

## Projects Overview

### 1. Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (`BasicEDA.ipynb`)
My first deep dive into real-world data using NYC real estate sales data. This project taught me the fundamentals of data cleaning, handling missing values, and identifying outliers in messy datasets.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (`KNN.ipynb`)
My introduction to supervised learning using bike sharing data to predict rental counts. Applied KNN regression with cross-validation to find optimal parameters and compared performance against linear regression.

### 3. Linear Regression Model (`LinearRegressionModel.ipynb`)
Comprehensive exploration of linear regression using both NYC real estate data and Boston housing data. Worked with polynomial features and learned about the bias-variance tradeoff through hands-on experimentation.

### 4. Regularization Techniques (`Linear_Ridge_ElasticNet_LASSO.ipynb`)
Explored Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net regression methods to prevent overfitting. Applied different regularization techniques to understand how they control model complexity.

### 5. Logistic Regression (`LogisticRegression.ipynb`)
My introduction to classification problems, moving from predicting continuous values to predicting categories and probabilities using logistic regression algorithms.

### 6. Principal Component Analysis (`PCA.ipynb`)
Learned dimensionality reduction techniques to identify the most important patterns in high-dimensional data and visualize complex datasets in reduced dimensions.

### 7. Random Forest (`RandomForest.ipynb`)
Explored ensemble learning methods by combining multiple decision trees. Applied random forest algorithms for both regression and classification tasks while analyzing feature importance.

## Development Environment

All projects are developed using:
- **Platform:** Google Colab for Jupyter notebooks
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Data Sources:** Real-world datasets provided by instructor
- **Approach:** Hands-on learning with practical applications
